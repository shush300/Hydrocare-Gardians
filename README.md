# Hydrocare-Gardians
A project for a sustainable and healthy life by treating wastewater from Textile factories and turning it into suitable water for irrigation, with the addition of a website to be easily used by the farmers so they can use the project by themselves.

# Project's Design
*Vertical prototype⭢ for easy water flow downwards

*Wooden Holder⭢ to carry the containers (replaced by a large metallic cylinder in the real-life application)

*Gauze or mask sheets⭢ are used to carry the treatment components and allow water to pass through, and decrease turbidity

*Sensors and meters⭢ for detecting if water reaches the suitable value of each parameter 

*Water pump⭢ for moving the water from down to up, so the water can undergo many cycles as needed

*3 plastic recycled jars⭢ for achieving sustainability and to hold the water in each treatment(not found in real-life application)

# Project features

* a low-cost, multi-stage water filtration solution
  
* Treating wastewater—especially from textile sources—using natural, chemical, and physical methods, supported by smart monitoring.

* Arduino-based system controls pumps and solenoid valves.
  
* Sensors (pH and TDS) monitor water quality in real time.

* Built from recycled and affordable materials.
  
* Modular and easy to maintain.

* Ideal for low-resource settings and educational use.

* Promotes natural treatment methods and chemical reduction.
  
* Supports sustainable reuse of wastewater in agriculture or non-potable needs.

# Recommendations for the future
* **Use bio balls or ceramic rings** for biological treatment to support beneficial bacteria and break down ammonia and organic waste.
  
* **Increase the filter’s surface area** to enhance contact time and improve filtration efficiency.
  
* **Install a fan in the first treatment stage** to accelerate salinity reduction through better air circulation.
  
* **Apply the system in real-world settings** such as factory wastewater outlets or water desalination plants
  
* **Incorporate zeolite with Moringa seeds** to absorb sodium and ammonium ions, reducing salinity.
  
* **Add graphene oxide** to filter multiple gases, including fine particulate matter like **PM 2.5**.
